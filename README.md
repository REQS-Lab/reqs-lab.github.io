Lab Director: Dr. Davor Svetinovic

Affiliated Faculty (to be confirmed): Dr. Khaled Elbassioni, Dr. Andreas Henschel, Dr. Zeyar Aung, Dr. Yousef Al Salami

Description: REQS Lab is a forward-thinking research initiative dedicated to exploring and advancing the field of ethical, secure, and sustainable technology at the intersection of blockchain, decentralized AI, and quantum computing. Our mission is to pioneer innovative solutions and methodologies that ensure emerging technologies' ethical use, robust security, and environmental sustainability. We are committed to developing quantum-secured systems that can operate within blockchain and decentralized AI, ensuring trust and integrity in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

Research Initiatives for the Next 5 Years:

1.	Quantum-Resistant Blockchain Protocols: Investigating and developing blockchain protocols that are secure against quantum computing threats. This includes creating post-quantum cryptographic algorithms and exploring quantum key distribution methods for blockchain networks.
2.	Ethical Frameworks for Quantum-AI Integration: Developing guidelines and frameworks for the ethical use of AI in quantum computing environments. This involves studying the implications of quantum-AI interactions and ensuring responsible and sustainable use of these technologies.
3.	Sustainable Quantum Computing Models: Exploring energy-efficient quantum computing models that can enhance the sustainability of decentralized AI and blockchain systems. Research includes developing low-power quantum algorithms and sustainable practices in quantum computing.
4.	Decentralized AI on Quantum Networks: Advancing the integration of decentralized AI systems with quantum networks. This includes researching secure AI data sharing over quantum channels, quantum-secured smart contracts, and distributed AI processing using quantum computing.
5.	Trust and Security in Quantum-Enabled AI: Focusing on building trust and enhancing security in AI systems enabled by quantum computing. This encompasses developing secure AI algorithms for quantum environments, ensuring the privacy and integrity of AI interactions, and studying the impact of quantum technologies on AI trustworthiness.
The REQS Lab will create a multidisciplinary platform for researchers from various fields, including quantum physics, computer science, ethics, and environmental studies, to collaborate and innovate in these exciting areas of technology.
